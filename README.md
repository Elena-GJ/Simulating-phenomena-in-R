# Important consideration to run this code
It is important to know that the code does not run properly on cmd, but I do not know the reason. To properly run it, it is better to run it in the IDE RStudio.

# Simulating phenomena in R
Those are the projects I did for my master's degree, concretely for the subject "Simulation techniques", in which we had to simulate the different proposed phenomena using the programming language R. I also upload for each one the report we had to do to show the obtained results and their conclussion (because of the nature of the evaluation, the reports are in Spanish and are .pdf files).

## Martingale
The first file simulates the martingale method of bidding, making with this code a study about the behaviour of this method when you change the initial amount of the bidding, the initial amount of the resources available, and many other possible variables that could influence the result. Finally, an interactive version of the martingale is available.

## Conway's Game of Life
The second file simulates Conway's Game of Life. Again, after simulating the proposed practice in R, I made a report taking as the dependent variable the final number of living cells as a function of variables such as the size of the grid, the initial probability of living cells or the rules for creating or maintaining life, among other variables.
In order to better visualize the changing of the matrix created, the results were shown in a .gif file when requested.
